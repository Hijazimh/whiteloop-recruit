Project creation — what to ask (and why)
1) Project basics

Project title – clear internal handle for matching & emails.

Short summary (1–2 lines) – used in listings; boosts applicant conversion.

Research goal / key questions – informs screener + insight templates.

Domain / category (e.g., fintech, e-comm) – improves matching & marketplace filters.

Sensitivity level (low/med/high) – toggles extra consent & PII handling.

2) Methodology

Format (1:1 interview, usability test, focus group) – determines room type & capacity.

Session length (minutes) – drives reward, scheduling buffers, and credit usage.

Number of participants (total & per session) – controls quotas & budget checks.

Moderator provided by (researcher/Whiteloop) – affects staffing & pricing.

3) Target audience & eligibility

Geography (countries/regions, remote vs on-site) – legal + payout feasibility.

Languages (required, nice-to-have) – matching & transcription model.

Demographics (age ranges, gender, education, income) – hard eligibility.

Experience/behaviors (e.g., “bought online 2× in last month”) – actual signal.

Exclusions (competitors, recent study participation) – bias reduction.

4) Screener setup

Screener questions (single/multi/scale/text) – prequalifies at scale.

Must-pass rules (e.g., country ∈ {UAE, KSA}) – instant reject saves time.

Scored rules + threshold – rank candidates when supply is high.

Auto-approve (on/off) – speed vs control trade-off.

5) Quotas & balancing

Quota cells (e.g., 50% KSA, 50% UAE; min 30% female) – prevents skew.

Max per demographic cell – stops overfilling early cohorts.

Reserve/waitlist size – protects against no-shows.

6) Incentives & budget

Participant reward per session (currency) – applicant conversion + fairness.

Researcher budget/escrow – payout guarantees & fraud prevention.

No-show rules (partial/none) – sets expectations and ledger logic.

7) Scheduling

Recruiting window (start/end dates) – supply planning & email cadence.

Session window (date range, time-of-day, timezone) – calendar constraints.

Scheduling method (Cal.com link vs manual slots) – UX + automation.

Buffer time (pre/post) – prevents overlap & cognitive load.

8) Consent, privacy & compliance

Recording & transcription consent – legal must-have.

Data retention period – storage costs + GDPR/PDPL.

PII handling (minimize/standard/extended) – toggles masked views & exports.

Recontact permission – future longitudinal studies & CLV.

9) Materials & tasks

Stimuli links/files (prototypes, URLs, docs) – ensure readiness.

Moderator guide / task list – quality & consistent insights.

Environment requirements (desktop/mobile, headphones) – data quality.

10) Quality & anti-fraud

Identity/KYC level (none/light/strict) – risk vs friction.

Tech checks (camera/mic/speed) – reduce failed sessions.

Duplicate participation policy – protects dataset integrity.

11) Transcription & insights

Transcription model (fast/accurate) – cost vs quality.

Insight output (themes, quotes, sentiment, JTBD, “5 Whys”) – report structure.

Highlight reels (on/off) – shareable clips for stakeholders.

12) Deliverables & success criteria

What “done” looks like (e.g., 12 completed 45-min interviews) – exit condition.

KPIs (completion rate, qualified rate) – operational health.

Report format (PDF, GDoc, CSV of insights) – handoff clarity.

13) Team & permissions

Research team members – workspace access & notifications.

Stakeholder viewers (read-only) – sharing without editing.

14) Communication preferences

Notification cadence (daily digest, realtime) – signal vs noise.

Contact channel (email/Slack webhook) – keeps teams in flow.

Participant comms tone (formal/friendly) – brand consistency.

15) Localization & accessibility

UI language(s) – recruit locally; Arabic/RTL for MENA.

Accessibility needs (captions, larger text) – inclusive research.

16) Risk & escalation

Potential risks (sensitive topics, distress) – moderator guardrails.

Escalation contact – fast issue resolution.

17) Legal docs

NDA (upload or template) – protects unreleased concepts.

Terms acceptance – enforceable ground rules.

18) Marketplace visibility

Visibility (private/invite-only/public listing) – control demand.

Study page excerpt – copy for participant marketplace.
